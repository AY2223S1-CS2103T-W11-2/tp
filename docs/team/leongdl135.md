### Project: ProfNUS

ProfNUS is a **desktop application which helps SOC Professors who have many modules with many students/TAs to manage.** It is optimized for users who prefer CLI over GUI so that frequent tasks can be done faster by typing in commands.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

  * Implemented `Student` class to hold information regarding students.
  * Implemented the `editstu` command to edit students in the student list.
  * Implemented the `editta` command to edit teaching assistants in the teaching assistant list.

  * Implemented the `delstu` command to delete students.
  * Implemented the `delta` command to delete teaching assistants.
