### Project: ProfNUS

ProfNUS is a **desktop application which helps SOC Professors who have many modules with many students/TAs to manage.** It is optimized for users who prefer CLI over GUI so that frequent tasks can be done faster by typing in commands.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**:
  * Implemented `Student` class to hold information regarding students.
  * Implemented the `madd` command to add modules to the list of modules.
  * Implemented the `mdel` command to delete modules in the list of modules.
  * Implemented the `JsonAdaptedModule` for storing information about a module.
  * Implemented the `medit` command to edit information about a module that exists in the list of modules.
  * Implemented the `vtarget` command to display more information about a module in `mlist`.
  * Implemented the on click GUI to display more information about a module in `mlist`.
