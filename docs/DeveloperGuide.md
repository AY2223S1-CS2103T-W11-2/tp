### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>
<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>

#### Schedule

**API** : [Schedule.java](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W11-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/module/schedule)

<img src="images/ScheduleUML.png" alt="ScheduleUML" style="zoom:65%;" />

The `Schedule` component

- represents a schedule of its corresponding module

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative design is to let `Schedule` object have a reference of the module it belongs to. The diagram is as follows:<br>

<img src="images/NewScheduleUML.png" alt="NewScheduleUML" style="zoom: 50%; width=450" />

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)



### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Find module details by module code feature
#### Implementation

The find module details mechanism is facilitated by `ModuleViewCommand` and `ModuleViewCommandParser`. It allows users to search for modules based on module code.
It uses `ModelManager#updateFilteredModuleList(Predicate<Module> predicate)` which is exposed in the Model interface as `Model#updateFilteredModuleList(Predicate<Module> predicate)`.
The method updates the student and tutor list and filters it according to the given predicate which will then be reflected accordingly in the GUI.

The following sequence diagram shows how the find module by module code operation works:
![ViewModuleSequenceDiagram](./images/ViewModuleSequenceDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a findmod command:

![ViewModuleActivityDiagram](./images/ViewModuleActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How mview executes

|                                             | Pros                                                     | Cons                                    |
| ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Option 1** <br/> Searching by module code | Allows module with different codes to have the same name | User might not remember the module code |
| **Option 2** <br/> Searching by module name | Easier for user to search for the module                 | Modules cannot have the same name       |

Reason for choosing option 1:
Modules like CS2103T, CS2103R and CS2103 have the same module name "Software Engineering". If we allow searching by module name, the program would not know which "Software Engineering" module to display.
This would mean that we would need to have unique module names. However, this is not possible if the professor is teaching modules that have the same name but different code.

### [Proposed] AddSchedule feature
#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed add schedule functionality is accomplished by `AddScheduleCommand` which extends the `Command` class. The `AddScheduleCommand` overrides the following method:

- `AddScheduleCommand#execute(Model model)` â€” Executes the command and add the new schedule to the ProfNUS

The following sequence diagram shows how add schedule operation works

![AddScheduleSequence](images/AddScheduleSequence.png)

After the ProfNUS receives the instruction to add a new `Scheudule`, it will find the corresponding `Module` and add the new schedule to its schedule list.

During the execution, the following validity checks will be conducted:

- Module existance check â€” The model will check if it can find the module indicated by the new schedule. If no module is found, then a `CommandException` will be thrown.
- Schedule conflict check â€” The model will check if the new schedule conflicts with any existing schedules that the user has. If conflict happens, then a `CommandException` will be thrown.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the command isn't executed successfully and a `CommandException` is thrown, then the new schedule won't be added to the ProfNUS.

### [Proposed] EditSchedule feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed edit schedule functionality is accomplished by `EditScheduleCommand` which extends the `Command` class. The `EditScheduleCommand` overrides the following method:

- `EditScheduleCommand#execute(Model model)` â€” Executes the command and edit the target schedule with new information

The following sequence diagram shows how add schedule operation works

![EditScheduleSequence](images/EditScheduleSequence.png)

After the ProfNUS receives the instruction to edit a target `Scheudule` (indicated by the index in the shown schedule list), it will modify it based on new information given by the user. 

During the execution, the following validity checks will be conducted:

- Index validity check â€” The model will check if the index is valid. More specifically, the index should be within the range of $1$ to $n$ where $n$ is the total number of schedules. If the index is invalid, then a `CommandException` will be thrown.
- Schedule conflict check â€” The model will check if the edited schedule conflicts with any existing schedules that the user has. If conflict happens, then a `CommandException` will be thrown.
- Optional parameters check â€” The parser will check if at least one of fields of the `Schedule` is edited. If no modification exists, then a `ParserException` will be thrown.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the edit schedule command isn't executed successfully and a `CommandException` or `ParserException` is thrown, then no schedule will be edited.
